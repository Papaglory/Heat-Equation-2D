## Description
DUMMY TEXT:
This project showcases a simple implementation of rendering a box in 3D space using mathematics from linear algebra. Furthermore, we apply rotation matrices to the box to rotate it. This allows for visualizing a rotating 3D box in a virtual environment. 

By considering a three-dimensonal space containing a cube represented by 8 vertices and a viewer (camera) represented by a vertex, we can render the box in the eyes of the viewer on a two-dimensonal plane (computer screen). 

## Dependencies

Uses the javax.swing package to render graphical elements and the EJML java library version 0.43 (simple matrix) for matrix calculations.
